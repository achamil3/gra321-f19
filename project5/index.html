    <h1>28 Art Shows Worth Traveling For</h1>
    <h2>Book your tickets to Paris, Belgrade, São Paulo, Lagos and London: Our critic’s Grand Tour this fall offers Leonardo, Brancusi, Kara Walker and Marina Abramovic, among the global highlights.</h2>
    <p>PARIS The world’s most popular museum is officially too popular: The Musée du Louvre, facing unprecedented summer crowds on several days in August, had to close its doors to thousands of Mona Lisa lovers. Yet if you think the lines are long now at the old Parisian palace, already on course to break last year’s record attendance of 10 million visitors, prepare for Oct. 24. That day, the Louvre opens “Leonardo da Vinci” — a decade-in-the-making, booking-required blockbuster, and the most significant exhibition in this 500th-anniversary year of everyone’s favorite Tuscan-Milanese-French polymath and conspiracy wellspring.</p>
    <p>The focus is on painting, and the Louvre’s own Leonardos — John the Baptist with his corkscrew curls; the smoky “Virgin of the Rocks” — will join friends from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum and the collections of Queen Elizabeth II and Pope Francis. (The Mona Lisa itself won’t budge; she stays in the sky-lit Salle des États.) A diplomatic dispute with Italy has pushed the fate of several major loans to the wire. Another absence seems assured: “Salvator Mundi,” the so-called Leonardo that hasn’t been seen since it sold at Christie’s for $450 million.</p>
    <p>If you’re joining the crowds for Leonardo, give yourself several days to take in the city’s saturated fall season. At the Grand Palais, a big-time retrospective of El Greco spotlights the Greek-Spaniard’s torqued, cracked visions of divinity, four centuries old but startlingly modern. (It’s open Oct. 16-Feb. 10; the curator is Guillaume Kientz, of the Kimbell Art Museum, who hit the bull’s-eye with his Velázquez show here in 2015.) The Pompidou Center probes Francis Bacon’s passion for literature (Sept. 11-Jan. 20), while the Musée d’Orsay examines Degas’s passion for opera (Sept. 24-Jan. 19). At the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a star turn for the designer Charlotte Perriand will include full-scale reconstructions of her interiors (Oct. 2-Feb. 24). </p>
    <p>LONDON From Oct. 2 through April 5, Kara Walker will fill the central hall of Tate Modern with her urgent grotesques of American violence. I suggest, though, you wait at least two weeks before going, because on Oct. 17, the Tate opens an imperative exhibition of more than 200 works by Nam June Paik — the Korean-American inventor of video art who, half a century before our always-online era, found a place for humanity in the swim of ubiquitous media.</p>
